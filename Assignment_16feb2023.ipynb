    "  id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "  name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "  age INT\n",
    ");\n",
    "In this example, the \"id\" column is the primary key. It will uniquely identify each row in the \"students\" table.\n",

    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. \n",
    "It establishes a link between two tables and ensures referential integrity between them. \n",
    "The values in the foreign key column must match the values in the primary key column of the other table. \n",
    "This constraint ensures that the data in the foreign key column is valid and refers to an existing row in the other table.\n",

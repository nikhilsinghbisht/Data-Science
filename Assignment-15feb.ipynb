    "Both multiprocessing and multithreading are techniques used to achieve concurrent execution of code in computer programs. However, they differ\n",
    "in some key ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes simultaneously, each with its own memory space and system resources. Each process runs\n",
    "independently, and communication between processes is typically accomplished using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms such as pipes,\n",
    "shared memory, or message queues. Multiprocessing is typically used to take advantage of the processing power of multiple CPU cores or to\n",
    "isolate processes for security reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, multithreading involves running multiple threads within a single process. Threads share the same memory space and system \n",
    "resources as their parent process, and communication between threads is typically accomplished using shared memory. Multithreading is typically\n",
    "used to achieve concurrency within a single process and to improve the responsiveness of interactive applications, such as graphical user interfaces or web servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between multiprocessing and multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing typically requires more overhead to start and manage multiple processes, whereas creating new threads within a process is\n",
    "generally faster and less resource-intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because each process in multiprocessing has its own memory space, it is generally easier to isolate and protect processes from each other. \n",
    "In multithreading, shared memory between threads can make it harder to ensure thread safety and avoid race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is generally better suited to tasks that are CPU-bound, where parallel processing can provide a significant speedup. \n",
    "Multithreading is better suited to tasks that are I/O-bound, where concurrency can help avoid blocking and improve overall throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, debugging multithreaded programs can be more difficult than debugging multiprocess programs, due to the shared memory and \n",
    "potential for race conditions."

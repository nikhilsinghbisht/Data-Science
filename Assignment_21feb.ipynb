    "\n",
    "E-commerce: Web scraping is used to extract product information, prices, and customer reviews from e-commerce websites. This information can be used \n",
    "to monitor competitor prices, track inventory levels, and analyze customer sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Intelligence: Web scraping is used to extract data from social media platforms, news websites, and other online sources to monitor industry \n",
    "trends, track brand mentions, and analyze customer sentiment. This information can be used to make informed business decisions.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): Many websites provide APIs that allow users to access and retrieve data in a structured format. APIs \n",
    "provide a more reliable and efficient way of scraping data, but may require technical skills to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) Providers: These are third-party services that provide access to scraped data through APIs or web interfaces. DaaS providers\n",
